Examination of possession pathways through pass map data. Possessions are determined and every event and player contributing to
the pathway is logged. Possesion pathways are given a score depending on the final result of the pathway (turnover, shot, etc.)
Analysis is performed to determine the key parameters that make up a successful pathway such as length of the possesion, number 
of players involved and how inidividual players contribute to these pathways.
